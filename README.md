# my senior project is Cartesian robot for Remote Chemistry laboratory.

The objective of this project is to make the chemistry laboratory class that students cannot come to the lab to study by themselves in COVID-19 situation be able to be real-time studied from home or anywhere via website.
 This cartesian robot includes 7 stepper motors, 1 servo and 2 linear actuator solenoids. We use stepper motors for moving the structure of the robot that made of V-slot aluminium profiles, a servo for controlling gripper that use to pick and place the laboratory equipment like beaker etc., 2 linear actuator solenoids for shaking the substance in the test tube to mix the chemical substances and make it react faster. 
 The microcontroller of this robot is Arduino Mega 2560 & ESP8266. Arduino Mega 2560 is for controlling the robot by getting data from users controlling through the website. ESP8266 is for getting the command from users and sending to Arduino Mega 2560. Moreover there are IP Cameras to make the users can see the real-time experiment.
